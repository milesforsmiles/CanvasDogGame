# CanvasDogGame
This is a work in progress! Currently this game allows you to move a dog across the screen by pressing buttons to go left, right, up, or down using a Canvas. The radio buttons don't have backend functionality. The bark button works and adds random bark images over the canvas.

TODO: 
Add an owner graphic that moves with the dog. 
Make the canvas objects move automatically in the direction pressed until reaching the end of the screen.
Add a way to keep track of scores.
