# CanvasDogGame
This is a work in progress! Currently this game allows you to move a dog across the screen by pressing buttons to go left, right, up, or down using a Canvas. The bark button works and adds random bark images over the canvas.

TODO: 
Add an owner graphic that moves with the dog. 
Add a way to keep track of scores.
Follow DRY principle better.
